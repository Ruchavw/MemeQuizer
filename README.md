## Overview

This project uses tkinter, a binding to the Tk GUI toolkit for Python. The project consists of gui pages to login or signup, select a difficulty level for the quiz, conduct the quiz, display the players score and a meme corresponding to the score. The database stores user details while logging in and signing up as well as highest score of all the times the user played the quiz so far. The quiz questions are stored in json files, one for each difficulty level. The final page displays the leaderboard, showing names and highest scores of top 5 players.
